        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;DIES IN HOUSE IN WHICH HE WAS BORN &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Frederick R. Bechtel of Brookside, Passes Away. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Frederick R. Bechtel, aged 80 years, 2 months, and 27 days, died at 7 p.m. Wednesday, at the Bechtel homestead, Brookside, in which he was born, after a lingering illness. He was a son of Christian and Julia (nee Reese) Bechtel, both deceased, and was born Sep. 17, 1830. Although his ill health extended over a period of several months, during which time he was able to be about the house and to walk about the yard on pleasant days without assistance, his will power was so great that he was confined to his room less than a week. Mr. Bechtel spent his entire life on the farm on which he was born, with the exception of a few years , when , as a young man, he lived in Reading. He never took an active part in politics, but served several terms as a Director of the schools of Cumru township. He was a lifelong member of Trinity Lutheran Church, this city, and for many years was a teacher in the Sunday school. Mr. Bechtel is survived by his widow, Esther (nee High), and two sons and two daughters, Charles H Bechtel, Lake, Idaho; John H. Bechtel, Reading; Emma A. and Sarah E. Bechtel, at home.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Glen Rose man killed&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A Glen Rose man was killed Monday night after his motorcycle struck a car on State Highway 144 South.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gregory Charles Cornell, 40, a laid-off engineer from Comanche Peak nuclear plant, died of head injuries, said highway patrol trooper Dub Gillum. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gillum gave an account of the 7:45 p.m. accident that occurred near Flip Stop convenience store.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cornell was southbound on State Highway 144 South on a 1984 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. &amp;nbsp;James Roger Shackleford, 39, a Granbury auto mechanic, was southbound ahead of Cornell in a 1969 Ford LTD. &amp;nbsp;Shackleford slowed down to turn into a private drive. &amp;nbsp;As Shackleford started to turn, Cornell attempted to pass his vehicle in the northbound lane. &amp;nbsp;Cornell&apos;s motorcycle then struck Shackleford&apos;s car in the rear. &amp;nbsp;Cornell was thrown from the motorcycle and died when his head struck the pavement. &amp;nbsp;Shackleford&apos;s car went off the road after impact and struck a fence. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cornell was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, but it didnâ€™t save his life, said Gillum. &amp;nbsp;The helmet, which Gillum described as a bowl-style helmet, was not Department of Transportation (DOT) approved.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A sample of Cornell&apos;s blood was taken to determine if alcohol was a factor in the accident, Gillum stated.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No citations were filed, Gillum reported, adding the investigation is continuing.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cornell&apos;s body was transferred to Georgia yesterday for burial, Gillum said, adding he is survived by a wife, a 4-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Others are Elected At Annual Meeting of Rajah Temple&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Floyd W. Fett, advertising representative of the Reading Eagle Times was elected illustrious potentate of the Rajah Temple, Mystic Shrine, last night to succeed Clarence E. Hess of Tamaqua.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;P.C. Fritz Williams of Reading was elevated from assistant rabban to chief rabban - the position vacated by Fett - which puts him next in line for the potentate&apos;s post.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[â€¦]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fett and Williams were appointed representatives to the Imperial Council in Atlantic City, N.J., in July.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fett, the new potentate, has been active in civic organizations for many years and has been a key figure in the establishment of the American Business Club&apos;s cerebral palsy clinic in the Charles S. Foos School&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A report by Giles showed that the Temple debt has been decreasing rapidly and that some time in 1954 the Temple will be completely debt-free.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Temple membership now exceeds 6,100 and is the highest in more than 25 years, Hetzog reported last night to approximately 700 attending members.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Floyd W. Fett, Local Adman, Dies at 65&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;FLOYD W. FETT&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Floyd W. Fett, 65, veteran advertising man, former publisher and a past potentate of Rajah Temple, died from a hear attack at 4:15 p.m. yesterday at his home, 924 Madison Ave.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;He had been under the care of a physician since suffering a heart attack about one year ago, but recently was in apparently good health and on Friday performed his usual duties as a display advertising salesman for the Reading Eagle-Times. &amp;nbsp;He spent yesterday at home.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Early in the afternoon he complained of severe heart pains and went to bed. &amp;nbsp;Members of the family summoned his physician, but he was dead when the doctor arrived.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;He was a native of Reading, a son of the late John L and Kathryn B. (Lebo) Fett, and was a veteran of WWI, serving with a U.S. Army unit.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Fett in early life was a printer, but left that work to enter the advertising field as a representative of department stores.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Later he became publisher of the Reading Shopping Bulletin, a weekly publication, and continued in that position for some years. &amp;nbsp;He was a display advertising salesman for the Reading Eagle-Times during the last four years.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;He was widely known for his activities in the Masonic Order and in 1954 was potentate of the Rajah Temple of the Shrine. &amp;nbsp;In May of that year he was elected to a term as president of the Pennsylvania State Shrine Assn.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;He was one of 16 applicants for the position of Reading postmaster to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Walter A. Ringler. &amp;nbsp;In July, 1952, he was declared one of three elligible for the position.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Fett was a member of Holy Spirit Lutheran Church; Isaac Hiester Lodge No. 660, F&amp;amp;AM; Reading Consistory and Rajah Temple, and at his death was secretary of the Pennsylvania State Shrine Assn. &amp;nbsp;He was for many years an active member of Reading Typographical Union No 86 and maintained his membership after his withdrawal from employment as a printer.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Surviving are his widow, Florence E (Bechtel) Fett; three daughters; Clementine, wife of Paul R Black, Opa-locka, Fla; Gene C., wife of George E. May, Reading and Marjorie E. wife of Robert E. Rettgers, Laureldale; &amp;nbsp;also eight grandchildren.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;T.C. Auman Inc., funeral directors, are in charge of the arrangements.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;An Aged Lady&apos;s Life&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Mrs. Hannah Fry, who will celebrate her 91st Birthday tomorrow -- the Mother of 9 children -- Sheared Sheep and Spun Wool in Her Younger Days&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Birdsboro: &amp;nbsp;In these days of hurry and scurry, disregard for the rules of hygiene and other regulations that conduces to longevity, one scarcely hears of the survival of a resident beyond the three score and ten limit. &amp;nbsp;Should there perchance be one who reached the age of &amp;quot;four score years,&amp;quot; such person is regarded as one specially favored by Providence, and the dwellers in the neighborhood flock to see him or her and listen to the recital of long ago happening and endeavoring to learn the secret of their drawn out lease of life.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Birdsboro feels proud of the distinction of having a dweller in its midst who has withstood the tempestuous sea for the unusual period of more than 90 years. &amp;nbsp;This person is Mrs. Hannah Fry, who on Monday next, Sept. 23, will celebrate the 91st anniversary of her birth. &amp;nbsp;The history of this old lady is a very interesting one and her memory reaches back to the war of 1812.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mrs. Fry was born September 23, 1804, in Robeson, about 1 1/2 miles from the Plow church. &amp;nbsp;Her father was Jacob Seibert, a thrifty farmer, who prided himself upon the constant find condition of his land and his successful raising of stock. &amp;nbsp;Her mother&apos;s name was Catharine, and she was the daughter of Jasper Wolf, who also was a farmer living near Beckersville. &amp;nbsp;When a girl, Mrs. Fry attended the Plow school, a short distance from her father&apos;s house; but the frequent necessity of her remaining at home to assist her mother in the housework, dairy, etc., deprived her of the means of acquiring much if an education, and her knowledge of books is very limited. &amp;nbsp;She feels the loss of advantages in this direction exceedingly, as she could employ her time in reading, were she better skilled in the art.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She was married to Peter Fry, of Robeson, who was then a school teacher and afterwards worked at the stone-mason trade. &amp;nbsp;He died 22 years ago and Mrs. Fry no makes her home with Mrs. Charles Painter, her granddaughter, on Mill st., this borough. &amp;nbsp;After the death of her husband, she states, that many of her friends advised her to marry a second time, but she disdained their counsel, thinking that she had had trouble enough in one experience. &amp;nbsp;She kindly cautioned your representative against taking a matrimonial step and assured him that she make a point of similarly discouraging all her young friends.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mrs. Fry had 3 brothers, John, Jacob, and Abram, all of whom are now dead after reaching ages varying from 60 to 70 years. &amp;nbsp;Her sisters, of whom she had 3, were Kate, who was first married to Isaac Glass and after this death to Isaac Witman; Betsy, married to Geo. Blankenbiller, and Mary, who was never married. &amp;nbsp;All these are now dead, the last named having passed to her rest last August, aged 80 years.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mrs. Fry has in her possession a certificate that is written in German and decorated with many colored drawings as a border, and is filled out as follows:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Mrs. Hannah Fry, daughter of Jacob Seibert and his wife Catharine (Wolf), was born in Robeson township, Berks county, September 23, 1804, a three o&apos;clock in the morning. &amp;nbsp;Baptized in infancy in the Plow church by Rev. John Plott. &amp;nbsp;The sponsors were Casper Wolf and wife, Catharine.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The writing is in a very good hand, and distinct, while the certificate, with the exception of a few breaks where the folds are, is in a very good state of preservation.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The old lady was a regular attendant upon the services at the Plow church for many years, but did not become a member of any congregation until she came to reside in Birdsboro. &amp;nbsp;She then decided to identify herself with St. Mark&apos;s Lutheran church here, and was confirmed by the pastor, Rev. Z. H. Gable, on Saturday afternoon, April 29, 1983, and has since been a consistent communicant and attended service whenever able to do so. &amp;nbsp;Many are the interesting reminiscences of life of this aged lady and in relating some of them she spoke of the FALLING OF THE STARS in the month of August, 1833. &amp;nbsp;She had gotten up very early in the morning to prepare breakfast for her husband, who intended to walk to Birdsboro, where he was employed up the mason work of the large grist mill building now operated by Reigner &amp;amp; Focht. &amp;nbsp;The heavens were full of shooting stars and the sight was one she will never forget. &amp;nbsp;It caused her much alarm and in describing what she thought was the &amp;quot;world coming to an end.&amp;quot; she said: &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;The stars fell like snow-flakes, some appearing to touch the earth.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;She was afraid to permit her husband to leave for his work, and it was not until daylight appeared that her courage returned and she granted him her consent.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In those days there was no watchmaker nearer than Reading and the residents of the rural districts were obliged to await the periodical visits of an itenerant clock repairer to have their time-pieces cleaned and adjusted. &amp;nbsp;It happened that this wandering mechanic came into the neighborhood the day following the phenomenon of the &amp;quot;falling stars&amp;quot; to whom Mrs. Fry related what she had seen in connection with it and expressed her superstitious fears of its being an ill-omen. &amp;nbsp;The visitor, who was a German, dispelled her anxiety by explaining that &amp;quot;the stars at certain times fall to the earth to clean themselves.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She was a lover of horseback riding and in this manner made weekly trips to the country store with butter and eggs and brought back groceries needed for the household. &amp;nbsp;In her girlhood days wheat and rye were mixed together as a substitute for coffee, and was regarded as a great luxury. &amp;nbsp;Her father raised a great many sheep and before she was married she was obliged to assist in shearing them and to spin the wool into cloth. &amp;nbsp;She took great pleasure in the work and became quite an adept in spinning both the flax and wool. &amp;nbsp;She used to knit all the stockings for the household, and after her marriage made in this way all the hosiery required for their own family, thinking it but a trifling task to finish a pair of long-leg stockings in two days, besides doing the entire work about her kitchen and dairy.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mrs. Fry&apos;s stories of deep snows, heavy rains, high water, &amp;nbsp;husking parties, apple-butter stirrings, etc., are of such unusual happenings to the youth of today that she is never at a loss to secure an audience to listen to her interesting recitals of all those events of her early life. &amp;nbsp;Her first experience of the novelty of riding upon a railroad train was when she came from Joanna to Birdsboro upon the Wilmington &amp;amp; Northern a short time after that line was opened for traffic. &amp;nbsp;She has not quite dispossessed herself of her timidity for railroad travel and still prefers the &amp;quot;good old way&amp;quot; of driving.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For many years Mrs. Fry has been addicted to the habit of smoking and inadvertently indulges in &amp;quot;a whiff to solace her,&amp;quot; and can rarely be found without her pipe. &amp;nbsp;She acquired the habit when she was quite young, having been advised to smoke to relieve the quinsy, to frequent attacks of which she was subject. &amp;nbsp;When she is now feeling well she has no desire for her pipe, but says &amp;quot;that as long as her health is good and she knows anything she wants access to pipe and tobacco.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The story she tells of the sickness occasioned by her attempt to smoke is interesting and laughable in the extreme. &amp;nbsp;In the whole history of her long life she never tasted liquor but once and then was persuaded to do so by some friends just to see what it was like. &amp;nbsp;Her story is, that it took the skin off her tongue and her sick so that she resolved never to take it again. &amp;nbsp;A short time ago she refused to take brandy at her physicians advice when she was ill, but some was put into milk and the taste so disguised that she was unaware of having taken it. &amp;nbsp;She had per picture taken years ago in the shape of a daguerreotype, which was stolen from her house and never recovered. &amp;nbsp;In later years some photographs were taken by Charles A Saylor of Reading, to which her features still bear a strong resemblance.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;About 2 years ago Mrs. Fry received her second sight, and is not able to sew and read without the aid of spectacles. &amp;nbsp;She is not fully acquainted with nature&apos;s strange law of providing a &amp;quot;second sight.&amp;quot; and states that the reason she does not use glasses is because she cannot get any to suit her eyes and that of the many pairs she has tried in the past 2 years none are equal to giving her the satisfaction that her natural eye serves her. &amp;nbsp;She is very observant and there is little going on about her that she does not notice and fully perceive. &amp;nbsp;She is very fond of children and is much beloved by the young folks where she resides, who are ever ready and willing to do her a service.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During her lifetime she has suffered but little from sickness and always preferred trusting to nature&apos;s sway rather than enlist the advice and aid of a physician for said she: &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;I never had much faith in doctors.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the present time, all things considered, she is in the enjoyment of excellent health, has a good appetite, sleeps well and seldom complains of any suffering.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her memory is still true, her hearing acute and her strength of limb and nerve comparatively good, though she uses a cane to aid her in walking about the premises. &amp;nbsp;She is an exceptionally good talker, has a pleasant voice and is also a most attentive listener, drinking in every word and perceptibly reasoning out all that is said to her. &amp;nbsp;Her great age could never be divined from her appearance, for her features are quite clear cut and her skin reasonably free from the wrinkled and shrunken condition that characterizes the general effect of &amp;quot;Father Time&apos;s&amp;quot; cruel hand. &amp;nbsp;The greater part of the time this pleasant weather, is spent by her in the large rocking chair in the shade upon the front porch where she reaps much enjoyment from watching the passing vehicles and in frequent short talks with the passers-by, numbers of whom are well acquainted with her and invariably stop to speak a kind word of recognition and compliment her upon her good health, etc.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She has a remarkably sweet disposition and is kindly affectionate toward all, especially so to her granddaughter, Mrs. Painter, with whom she lives, and whom she dearly loves. &amp;nbsp;She is ever ready to praise the offices of good that Mrs. Painter has bestowed upon her and expresses it as her greatest desire that she should be allowed to pass the residue of her existence near her side, and within the sound of her voice.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mrs. Fry&apos;s matrimonial life was blessed with 9 children, of which 1 succumbed to an attack of measles when 5 years old, and 2 others lived until they were upwards of 50 years. &amp;nbsp;Six still survive - 4 boys and 2 girls. &amp;nbsp;Of the boys, Bently and Jacob reside in Birdsboro, Heber at Joanna, and John at Beckersville, while of the daughters, Mrs. Robert Westley lives at Joanna and Mrs. Lot Buckwalter at Reading.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her descendants number many, there being no less than 77 great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-grandchildren. &amp;nbsp;The old lady has of a truth &amp;quot;grown old gracefully,&amp;quot; and her present comparative sprightliness augurs the enjoyment of more years upon earth, surrounded by kind friends who will spare no pains to make her pathway one of ease to the end of life.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Three Men Buried In a Mine&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;CAVE IN AT THE IRON MINE AT FALLS OF FRENCH CREEK -- ONE MAN KILLED&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The iron mine at Falls of French Creek, Warwick township, Chester County, operated by E. &amp;amp; G. Brooke, of Birdsboro, this county, was the scene of an accident on Monday, the 15th inst., which resulted in the death of one man, and the slight injury of two others. &amp;nbsp;On the afternoon of that day, while Eber Hartenstine and two fellow miners were at work at the bottom of the shaft, by some unknown means about twenty tons of ore, rocks and earth were precipitated from the other side of the mine, burying in the debris the three men. &amp;nbsp;Several hours were spent in rescuing them, and when they were discovered, it was found that they all had sustained severe internal injuries, though those of Mr. Hartenstine were the most serious. &amp;nbsp;The last named gentleman was carried to his home at Pine Swamp, Warwick township, where he lingered in great agony until Tuesday evening when he died. &amp;nbsp;The other two whose names have not been learned, have nearly recovered from the effects of the accident.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Eber Hartenstine, the victim of the accident, was about 35 years of age and leaves a wife and several children. &amp;nbsp;He was a brother of Mr. Jacob Hartenstine, of Pottstown.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;LOSES HIS LIFE BY DROWNING&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;TRAGIC END OF A READING AVIATOR&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Herbert Hartenstein, of this city, a quartermaster in the naval air service of the United States government, met death in a most tragic manner on Monday, when the seaplane in which he, with others, was making a practice flight over the bay at Chatham, Mass., enveloped in a tailspin and fell. &amp;nbsp;Hartenstein and Lieut. Charles L Ostridge of Watertown, Mass., were drowned, while a third member of the crew. &amp;nbsp;Everett P. Welsh, was rescued by another seaplane.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This information was received by his wife, Mrs. Laura Hartenstein, 1017 Oley street, by telegraph. &amp;nbsp;The message follows: &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Chatham, Mass., May 19. &amp;nbsp;While making a practice flight over the bay here at 11 a.m. Monday, a naval seaplane in which Quartermaster Herbert Hartenstein was an occupant enveloped into a tailspin and fell, causing the death of Quartermaster Hartenstein.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another telegram followed, which informed the widow that members of the coast guard made unsuccessful efforts to resuscitate the Reading man, who was the first recovered. &amp;nbsp;The body of Lieut. Ostridge, of Watertown, Mass., who was drowned in the same accident, is still lost at sea.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Sorrow Follows Happiness&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The telegram informing Mrs. Hartenstein of the death of her husband arrived at their modest little home shortly after the wife had finished reading a letter of happiness received from her husband. &amp;nbsp;Hartenstein, in the letter, stated that he expected his discharge from the air service early in July and that he was going to return to Reading. &amp;nbsp;The wife is heartbroken and said: &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;I gave all I had.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;As her three-year-old son clung to her apron the stricken wife, wrought up over the news, explained through sobs how her husband met his death.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On Dec. 31, 1917, Hartenstein enlisted in the Naval Reserve Corpse at Philadelphia. &amp;nbsp;After receiving his preliminary training at a station there, he was transferred to Pensacola, Fla., where he remained until February, 1918. &amp;nbsp;In the early part of March, he was assigned to a naval air service unit and embarked for France. &amp;nbsp;He saw active service in foreign waters and was later attached to a patrol crew which moved between Brest and Bordeaux.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Following the signing of the armistice he, with his unit, left France for the States, arriving here Nov. 24, 1918. &amp;nbsp;He spent Thanksgiving Day visiting his wife and little son in Reading. &amp;nbsp;Upon his return to duty, he was reassigned to a patrol crew along Pelham Bay, N.Y. &amp;nbsp;In March he was removed to Chatham, Mass., where he was stationed for patrol duty.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The visit to his relatives in this city on Thanksgiving Day was a surprise. &amp;nbsp;None had heard of his safe arrival from overseas and when he entered his home on Oley street, his wife and parents were for a time speechless.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Blue Star Changed to Gold.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Upon the front door at the Oley street home, hangs a good size silk service flag bearing one blue star in the field of white. &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;That star will be replace by a gold one, &amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;and will hang on that door form some time to come. &amp;nbsp;He never cared for the display, but it was the only way in which we could demonstrate our admiration for his bravery and patriotism.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Quartermaster Hartenstein was 24 years old. &amp;nbsp;He was the son of Mrs. Thomas F.

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;AVIATOR&apos;s BODY ARRIVES&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The body of Quartermaster Herbert Hartenstein, of this city, connected with the naval service of the United States government, who met death in a most tragic manner on Monday, when the seaplane in which he, with others, was making a practice flight over the bay at Chatham, Mass, enveloped in a tailspin and fell, arrived in Reading, via the Reading Railway. &amp;nbsp;The remains left the naval academy at Chatham, Mass., at 5 p.m. Tuesday. &amp;nbsp;Undertaker Auman, who has charge of the funeral arrangements, met the body and removed it to the deceased&apos;s home at 1017 Oley street, from which place the funeral will likely take place. &amp;nbsp;No date has been set for the funeral, although it is expected to take place Friday or Saturday.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;A READING MAN BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN DROWNED&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Chatham, Mass. &amp;nbsp;May 19 -- Lieut. Charles L. Ostridge, of Reading, Pa., and Quartermaster Herbert Hartenstein, of Watertown, were believed to have lost their lives when a naval seaplane fell into the ocean off Orleans today. &amp;nbsp;Members of the Orleans coast guard crew and others who went out from the air station here, could be seen through classes several hours after the accident, apparently working over the men with a pulmotor, and officials still entertained hope that they might be alive. &amp;nbsp;Ensign Everett P. Welsh, a third member of the seaplane crew, was rescued by another machine and brought to the station hospital in a serious condition.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The men were making a practice flight, and observers said that the machine apparently went into a tail spin.&lt;/div&gt;

Hartenstine, who is engaged in the brick business on South st., and wife, celebrated the 25th anniversary of their marriage by entertaining a large number of friends at their residence, No. 407 Walnut st. &amp;nbsp;The evening was spent in a pleasant manner, and a fine supper added to its enjoyment. &amp;nbsp;Griessenger&apos;s band discoursed choice music. &amp;nbsp;Mr. Hartenstine, just 25 years ago, was married to Miss Eliza Nicolls, of Uwchland, Chester County, by the late Rev.

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Truck Hits Upset Auto; Woman Killed&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One person was killed and two escaped injury at 4 o&apos;clock Friday morning when an overturned automobile was struck and completely demolished by a tractor-trailer on the Gettysburg-Harrisburg Pike about four miles south of Dillsburg.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Killed instantly was Mrs. Nellie Heckard, 44, of Harrisburg, who died from a broken neck, fractured skull, crushed chest, broken right arm and two broken legs.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Drivers Unhurt&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Escaping serious injury were Mrs. Heckard&apos;s husband, William A., 36, operator of the automobile, and Charles Lau, 27 of Palmyra, driver of the tractor trailer.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Coroner E.A. Huegele, who conducted an investigation along with State Police, reported that Heckard&apos;s car, which was traveling south, swerved to right, went over an embankment, and swerved back into the middle of the highway where it came to a stop upside down. &amp;nbsp;Heckard, who was dazed when the car rolled over, was attempting to extricate his wife, when the huge tractor-trailer came over the brow of the hill. &amp;nbsp;Lau told State Police he was unable to stop before striking the Heckard automobile. &amp;nbsp;Mrs. Heckard&apos;s body was carried 200 feet in the demolished automobile. &amp;nbsp;Coroner Huegele said. &amp;nbsp;The Heckards were en route to Dillsburg R.D. 1 to visit Mrs. Heckard&apos;s son, Curtis T. Cornell.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Auto Demolished&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The tractor-trailer was owned by Ernest R. Nelson, of Palmyra. &amp;nbsp;There was little damage to the truck buy Coroner Huegele reported the entire front of the automobile was sheared off by the impact.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Mechanicsburg ambulance took Heckard to the Seidle Memorial Hospital in Mechanicsburg, where he was treated for minor lacerations. &amp;nbsp;Lau escaped without a scratch. &amp;nbsp;Heckard was unable to give a reason for his car going out of control and leaving the highway.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pending an inquest at a later date, both Heckard and Lau were released in $1,000 bond for their appearances.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Heckard Blamed In Wife&apos;s Death&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;William A. Heckard, 36, of Mt. Holly Springs, was held guilty of &amp;quot;some negligence&amp;quot; in the death of his wife who, a coroner&apos;s jury decided was killed when the Heckard car overturned and not when a truck crashed into the wreckage a short time later.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The jury exonerated the truck driver, Charles E. Lau, 27, of Palmyra, of all blame in the woman&apos;s death.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The accident occurred September 10 in the Williams Grove road near Rose Garden. &amp;nbsp;Dr. Edward A Haegele, Cumberland county coroner, directed in the inquest. &amp;nbsp;He said Heckard&apos;s car containing his 44-year-old wife, Mrs. Nellie Heckard, turned over. &amp;nbsp;Mrs. Heckard was pinned in the wreckage. &amp;nbsp;While Heckard and a passing truck driver were trying to extricate her, another truck, driven by Lau, crashed into the wrecked car. &amp;nbsp;Mrs. Heckard was dead when a physician arrived.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mechanicsburg, Pa., Sept. 10 -- William A Heckard, of Harrisburg today watched helplessly as a tractor-trailer plunged into the automobile wreckage where his way lay pinned. &amp;nbsp;State Police said Mrs. Nellie Heckard, 44, probably died instantly.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Heckard told police he may have fallen asleep early today while he and his wife were driving to a son&apos;s home in nearby Dillsburg, Pa.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Police said Heckard&apos;s car left Route 15 four miles south of Dillsburg, climbed a bank and then turned over on its side in the middle of the highway.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Heckard dazed by the crash, fought to get his wife free of the wreckage. &amp;nbsp;He barely escaped before the truck hit the overturned automobile where his wife lay.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The truck driver, Charles Lau, 27, Palmyra, Pa., escaped serious injury.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;DEATH OF WELL-KNOWN READING BUSINESS MAN&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;William K. High Passes Away Four Days After His 73d Birthday--Came to Reading 30 Years Ago.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A well-known retired farmer and local coal, flour and feed merchant, William R High, died of a complication of diseases superinduced by liver trouble at 7:30 o&apos;clock this morning at his home, 439 Woodward street just four days after his 73d birthday anniversary. &amp;nbsp;He had been ailing for the past few years. &amp;nbsp;About four weeks ago he recovered from a severe attack of illness and was able to be about. &amp;nbsp;On Monday he took to his bed again and sank gradually until death came.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mr. High was born and reared on the High homestead in Cumru township, and at the time of his death he was the owner of the place where he spent his boyhood days. &amp;nbsp;Thirty years ago he retired from the farm and moved to this city. &amp;nbsp;He engaged in the coal, flour and feed businesses at 312 Rose street. &amp;nbsp;He associated with him first his eldest son, Daniel K High, and later another son, Charles P High, who has conducted the business for the past five years, his father retiring from active pursuits in 1903.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mr. High was an active and life member of the Berks County Agricultural Society. &amp;nbsp;For a period of 30 years deceased was a Director in the Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Berks county, and for many years was its Treasurer. &amp;nbsp;Mr. High at the time of his death, was Treasurer of Yocum&apos;s Union Church, a position he held for four decades. &amp;nbsp;He was a devoted member of the Reformed denomination of that church.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Besides his widow, Lydia Ann (nee Krick), Mr. High is survived by five sons: &amp;nbsp;Daniel K. High, Robesonia; William R. And Charles P High, this city; Henry K. High, Ruscombmanor and Ezra K. High, Harrisburg; two sisters, Mrs. Fred Bechtel, Brookside, and Mary High, Reading, and nine grandchildren.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A pretty church wedding was that which took place at 3 o&apos;clock this afternoon in St. Peter&apos;s Methodist Church when Rev M. Shelley joined in wedlock Laura F. Hartenstine, a nurse. &amp;nbsp;17 Oley street, and Ithamar B Rettgers, 24 North Eleventh street. &amp;nbsp;A number of friends and relatives of the couple witnessed the ceremony which was followed to a reception at the bridegroom&apos;s home on North Eleventh street.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Miss Rhea E Drexel was at the organ. &amp;nbsp;Prior to the ceremony Miss Florence R Miller, soprano, sang O Promise Me. &amp;nbsp;During the ceremony Miss Drexel played At Dawning by Cadman.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Miss Ethel Goldman was the bridesmaid. &amp;nbsp;The best man was Earl Kraemer. &amp;nbsp;The bride was charmingly gowned in white georgette and carried a bouquet of white roses.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The bride is a graduate of the Reading Evening High School also the Reading Hospital Training School class 1920. &amp;nbsp;The groom is a locomotive fireman for the Reading Railway Co. &amp;nbsp;The newlyweds will spend their honeymoon visiting points of interest in the New England states.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mr. Rettgers holds quite a record as an overseas veteran. &amp;nbsp;He was sergeant first class of Co. D. 150th Machine Gun Battalion, and saw considerable action in all the major offensives on the French front. &amp;nbsp;He enlisted in Co. D two weeks after its return from the Mexican border and at which time it was then known as Co. I Fourth Regiment, N.G.P.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;National Guard Captain Gassed in France&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Illness due to World War injuries resulted in the death of Captain Ithamar B. Rettgers, of Battery G, 213th Coast Artillery, of the Pennsylvania National Guard.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The 39-year-old commander of the local battery died early today in the Reading Hospital from a stomach ailment which physicians traced to a gas attack of which Captain Rettgers was victim during the war. &amp;nbsp;He had undergone an operation last Thursday.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Enlisting in the National Guard on the day war was declared, Captain Rettgers carved out a notable army career. &amp;nbsp;Inducted into the federal service on August 25, 1917, he was assigned to Company A, 149th Machine Gun Battalion of the 42d, or Rainbow Division. &amp;nbsp;He was made a corporal three months later, and on May 4, 1918, was promoted to sergeant.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In Eight Major Battles&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As a sergeant, Captain Rettgers took part in eight major battles, becoming the victim of a gas attack in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. &amp;nbsp;He also served in the battles of Luneville, Baccarat, Esparence, Champagne-Marne, Aisne-Marne and St. Mihiel.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Captain Rettgers served with the army of occupation in Germany after the armistice.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Continuing his military activities after his return to this country, Captain Rettgers was commissioned a second lieutenant in the National Guard on February 12, 1920. &amp;nbsp;He was promoted to the first lieutenant under Captain William J Smith on December 22, 1929, and on January 22, 1931, was commissioned a captain.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Captain Rettgers was foreman of the stereotype department of the Reading Times. &amp;nbsp;He was a member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He was a member of the Windsor Street M.E. Church and a son of the late Frederick F and Sarah (Marion) Rettgers. &amp;nbsp;Surviving are his widow, Laura T. (Hartenstine), two sons, Forrest and Robert, and two daughters Miriam and Joyce; two brothers, Frederick, this city; Charles, Philadelphia, and two sisters, Ethel and Mazie, this city.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Funeral Saturday at 2 p.m., from the Henninger Funeral home. &amp;nbsp;The Rev. Leighton S Palmer officiating.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Military Funeral Held for Rettgers&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Veteran Groups Attend Service in Body&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A military funeral, attended by hundreds of representatives of veteran organizations, relatives and friends, was held this afternoon for Captain Thamar B. Rettgers at the Henninger Funeral home.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Rev. Leighten S. Palmer, pastor of Windsor Street M.E. Church of which the late world-war veteran was a member, conducted the rites.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the grave in Charles Evans Cemetery, Major Henry W. Prentiss, of Bethlehem, an officer at the Valley Forge Military College, conducted the committal service.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Officers of the 213th anti-Aircraft Coast Artillery Regiments, headed by Colonel C.J. Smith, Allentown, attended in a body. &amp;nbsp;The military and veteran organizations met at their respective headquarters and marched to the funeral home.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;March to Cemetery&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First Lieutenant Albert H. Early , of Captain Rettgers&apos; Battery G, and Captain John E Hickman, commander of Battery A, had their entire companies in a uniform and marched to the cemetery as an escort of honor.&lt;/div&gt;

Conner, Harry Roland, Harry Feather, Emerson Hoover, Stanley Witzel, Anthony Remba and Earl Wheeler.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Members of Old Company I, in which Captain Rettgers served in France as a private, corporal, and sergeant through some of the heaviest fighting of the World War, served as active bearers.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Among the organizations represented were Gregg Post, American Legion; Greater Reading Post, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Reading Artillerists.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Honorary Bearers&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The honorary bearers, officers of the Second Battalion were: &amp;nbsp;Major William J. Smith, First Lieutenant Ralph O. Bowman, Captain David J. Evans, First Lieutenant John r Oatman, Second Lieutenant Carroll E. Stauffer, Captain George T. Tucker, First Lieutenant Phillip H Melching, and Second Lieutenant John W. Feather.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A guard was placed at the bier from 1 o&apos;clock this afternoon until the funeral, at 2 o&apos;clock.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last evening more than 800 persons viewed the body. &amp;nbsp;During the morning hours, several hundred more pass the bier.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Captain Rettgers died early Wednesday in the Reading Hospital.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Six Local Post Office Workers to Serve As Bearers at Funeral&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Funeral services for Walter A. Ringler, Reading postmaster, who died Thursday evening, will be held Tuesday at 11 a.m. in the T.C. Auman, Inc., parlors with the Rev. Dr. Charles E. Roth, pastor of St. Andrew&apos;s Reformed Church, officiating. &amp;nbsp;Burial will be made in Aulenbach&apos;s Cemetery.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Moses S. Herbein, acting postmaster, today announced the names of six postal employees who will serve as bearers. &amp;nbsp;They are: George W. Emerich, of the supervisory staff; Luther Finerfrock, representing the clerks; Russell Herbein, carriers; Charles H. Hiester, mailhandlers; &amp;nbsp;Norman E. VonNeida motor operators, and Raymond Neidig, custodial services.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Office to Close&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Herbein announced that executive offices of the post office will be closed from 10:30 a.m. To 12:30 p.m. On Tuesday in respect to Ringler, who was postmaster for nearly 15 years.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The entire post office staff will visit the funeral home Monday evening at 7 o&apos;clock to pay their last respects to Ringler. &amp;nbsp;The public viewing will be held between 7 and 9 o&apos;clock.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The flag in front of the post office has been placed at half mast in tribute to the late postmaster. &amp;nbsp;Ringler took ill several weeks ago and early this week was injured in a fall, which apparently resulted from a stroke. &amp;nbsp;He died in St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital. &amp;nbsp;His wife is the only survivor. &amp;nbsp;They had no children.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Death of Ringler&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Closes Long Career&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Love of Work is Blamed for His Last Illness&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Unfailing devotion to duty and stubborn refusal to heed ailments of advancing years led to the death of Postmaster Walter A. Ringler, his widow said today.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The 71-year-old former assemblyman, county commissioner and city assessor, who would have rounded out 15 years as head of the Reading Post Office on June 28 succumbed in St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital at 9:45 o&apos;clock last night. &amp;nbsp;He would have been 72 on March 7. &amp;nbsp;Funeral arrangements had not been completed this morning.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although death was attributed directly to a brain injury caused either by a paralytic stroke or a fall against a radiator at his home, 47 South Eight St., Ringler suffered from exhaustion and heart trouble, Mrs. Ringler disclosed.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The postmaster caught a cold attending the funeral of County Commissioner John G. Keller, Ringer&apos;s personal friend and Democratic colleague of many years, who died 21 days ago. &amp;nbsp;Mrs. Ringler said that her husband refused to call a doctor until the cold developed into a touch of pneumonia and his temperature was 104 degrees.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was while recuperating that he suffered the fall, but he was not taken to the hospital until about a week later. &amp;nbsp;He was semi-conscious after his admittance to the hospital last Monday. &amp;nbsp;He failed to rally to treatment after numerous tests and X-rays.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mrs. Ringler said that working was her husband&apos;s pleasure and for this reason he rarely took a vacation. &amp;nbsp;She said he preferred to stay in harness despite his advancing years.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Leave Days Accumulated&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;His refusal to take a vacation from his post office duties piled up for him a total of approximately 183 days owed him by the department. &amp;nbsp;This was reduced to about 80 at the time of his death because his superiors in Washington ordered him take off one or two days a week during the last year or so.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ringler always said he would take a long vacation when he retired.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The 19-story court house, the county tuberculosis hospital and prison in Bern Township and the Buttonwood Street Bridge today stand as monuments to Ringler&apos;s career.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was during the 12 years that he was chairman of the county board of commissioners that these projects were constructed. &amp;nbsp;He directed the inauguration and supervision of a county program of public improvements the like of which never before and probably never again will be accomplished in a similar period of time.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was also under Ringler&apos;s chairmanship that the county launched a road-building program that gave Berks its first hard-surfaced rural highways. &amp;nbsp;Millions of dollars were expended for these various improvements and new buildings.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Had Simple Life&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although he ran the post office with the efficiency of a big business executive, his private life was simple. &amp;nbsp;Virtually his only pastime, except for an occasional motion picture, was a late afternoon pinochle game with a few cronies at the Americus Club. &amp;nbsp;Otherwise he enjoyed quiet evenings at home with his wife, the former Mary S. Hartenstine. &amp;nbsp;They had no children.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During his postmastership, postal receipts here increased from $660,000 to more than $1,500,000 annually.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While in office Ringler won the esteem of his employees when his name was placed on the honor roll of the National Federation of Post Office Clerks. &amp;nbsp;This honor is accorded to post office officials who ignore politics and personal favoritism and adhere rigidly to seniority rules in making appointment. &amp;nbsp;Ringler&apos;s name was placed on the honor roll upon nomination of the Reading members of the federation.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although running the post office was his immediate concern, Ringler enjoyed talking of the days when he was a county commissioner and directed many fights to give Berks County modern institutions and services. &amp;nbsp;He prided himself that he accomplished all these things as a self-made and self-educated man without much formal schooling.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He was born on a farm in Exeter Township on March 7, 1879, the son of William Ringler, a farmer, and Louisa Morgandale Ringler. &amp;nbsp;His father died when he was in sixth grade. &amp;nbsp;His mother then moved to Reading, where Ringler worked at odd jobs to support the family.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Worked at Shops&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Later he landed a job at the Reading Company shops. &amp;nbsp;That was in 1898. &amp;nbsp;He worked at the shops for 20 years, first as an apprentice, then as a journeyman, and finally as a foreman in the railroad machine shops.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was while working at the shops that he became interested in politics and in 1915 he decided to run for one of the two city seats in the General Assembly. &amp;nbsp;He was successful in his bid along with the late James H Maurer, Socialist leader, who won the other seat. &amp;nbsp;He was reelected for another two-year term.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For a time, Ringler had to stay out of politics because the government had taken over operation of the railroads during World War I and ruled that railroad employees must quit their rail jobs or get our of politics.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Won County Berth in 1919&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This didn&apos;t hold Ringler back long. &amp;nbsp;He aimed his sights for the county commissionership and was elected in the fall of 1919 without much trouble. &amp;nbsp;He took office the following January, was reelected twice and ended his tenure after the first major political defeat of his career in January 1932.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That same year he was an unsuccessful candidate for state senator from Berks. &amp;nbsp;Some months later he was appointed city assessor of Reading. &amp;nbsp;Fro a short time previously, he had been assistant assessor. &amp;nbsp;However, the assessorship lasted only until 1936 because a new Socialist administration was swept into city hall.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The postmastership became vacant that same year upon the retirement of the late Horace H Hammer.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Won Guffey&apos;s Support&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;More than a dozen applicants sought the post, but the old guard of the Democratic Party was solidly behind his candidacy and his appointment because assured when the then U.S. Sen. Joseph F Guffey threw the weight of his influence in favor of Ringler.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During the past 15 years Ringler&apos;s appointment came up for renewal several times. &amp;nbsp;Although new opposition developed, Ringler always won reappointment.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Besides the Americus Club, Ringler was a member of the Postmaster&apos;s Association, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, the Union Fire Company, the Veteran Fireman&apos;s Association, the Odd Fellows and the Bavarian Association.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The widow is the only survivor. &amp;nbsp;Funeral arrangements are in charge of T.C. Auman, Inc., Funeral directors. &amp;nbsp;Burial will probably take place in a plot at Aulenbach&apos;s Cemetery where his parents and two brothers are buried.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;The funeral of John Savage, aged 84 years, took place from his residence in Bern township at 10 a.m., and after a short prayer and the singing of several hymns at the house proceeded to Epler&apos;s Church, where services were conducted by Rev. R.S. Appel. &amp;nbsp;The remains were attired in a black silk robe and reposed in a solid walnut casket with silver trimmings, extension bar handles and plate bearing the deceased&apos;s name and age. &amp;nbsp;Interment at Epler&apos;s Church. &amp;nbsp;The report that deceased&apos;s wife had died is incorrect, but she was too sick to attend the funeral. &amp;nbsp;Her condition is quite critical. &amp;nbsp;Funeral Director Francis F Seidel had charge. &lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;CIVIL WAR VETERAN ANSWERS LAST CALL&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;John Savage, formerly of West Leesport, died at the home of his brother, Isaac H. Savage, 1627 Perkiomen avenue, at 3 o&apos;clock this morning, aged 84 years, 5 months and 14 days. &amp;nbsp;His wife, Susan (Moyer), preceded him in death almost three years. &amp;nbsp;There survive three sisters, Mary, wife of Henry Machemer, Leinbach&apos;s; Mrs. Henrietta Althouse, and Mrs. Emma Kauffman, and one brother, Isaac, all of this city.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mr. Savage was but 18 years of age when he enlisted, Sept 2, 1864, and was mustered in the U.S. Service at Harrisburg to serve for the duration of the war in Co. H, 205 regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, under Capt. Franklin Schmehl, and Col. J.A. Mathews. &amp;nbsp;The regiment proceeded to Washington, D.C., encamped at Ft. Corcoran, Va., thence to Camp Distribution, escorted 1,300 recruits to City Point and constructed earthworks and forts assigned to the 2d brigade, 3d division, 9th corps, Army of the Potomac under Gen. Hartranft. &amp;nbsp;He participated in the battles of Fort Steadman, March 25, 1865; Fall of Petersburg, April 2, 1865; pursuit of Lee along the South Side Railroad to Burkesville, until Lee surrendered &amp;nbsp;On one occasion he saw Abraham Lincoln on the firing line, witnessing the progress of the Union forces, much to the anxiety of the officers in command. &amp;nbsp;Comrade Savage shared in all its movements and engagements and narrowly escaped a trap set for a cavalry officer and himself by guerillas. &amp;nbsp;He was honorably discharged June 2, 1865 at Harrisburg, Pa., on account of the close of war.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Retired Iron Worker Passes Away Following Two Weeks&apos; Illness.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After an illness of two weeks from general debility, Jacob Seivard, a well known retired iron worker died yesterday morning at 11.20 o&apos;clock at his late residence, 467 North Evans street, at the age of 81 years, seven months, and nine days. &amp;nbsp;Although he had been in failing health for several years his condition was not serious and he was able to be about until two week ago.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Deceased came to Pottstown 47 years ago from St. Mary&apos;s Chester county. &amp;nbsp;He was a son of the late Abraham and Catharine Seivard. &amp;nbsp;For many years he worked as a puddler in the plant of the Pottstown Iron Company, but for the past five years he has lived retired.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He is survived by his widow, Ann, nee Hartenstine. &amp;nbsp;Had Mr. Seivard lived until Sept 11 the couple would have celebrated their 57th wedding anniversary. &amp;nbsp;Two children survive. &amp;nbsp;They are: &amp;nbsp;Laura, wife of Frazer Keen, and Charles B. Seivard, both of this borough. &amp;nbsp;The following brothers and sisters also remain: &amp;nbsp;Harry Seivard, of Reading; Kate, widow of William Williams&apos; of St. Mary&apos;s; Mary, widow of Heber Hartenstine, of Glen Moore, and Elizabeth, widow of Cyrus Hartenstine, of Maryland.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He also leaves four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mr. Seivard was a member of the First Methodist Church. &amp;nbsp;He was well known and enjoyed a host of friends in this borough as well as in the vicinity of his native home in St. Mary&apos;s.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The funeral will be held on Monday afternoon, Aug 26. &amp;nbsp;Services will be held from his late residence at three o&apos;clock. &amp;nbsp;Interment will be made privately in Pottstown Cemetery.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Hair Turns White When Girl Drowns Near Milledgeville&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga., Aug 15. &amp;nbsp;The body of Miss Eunice Smith, 18, nurse at the Georgia State Sanitarium, was recovered from the Oconee River at 5:30 o&apos;clock this morning, thirty-six hours after she lost her life while wading in the stream.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Arthur Layfield, to whom Miss Smith was engaged to wed, recovered the body while diving in the stream a half mile below the point where she was drowned.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Layfield is a brother of William Layfield, 14, who rescued Miss Mary Youngblood, another nurse of the State Sanitarium, who was wading in the stream with Miss Smith Friday evening, when both sand from sight.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The younger Layfield, after rescuing Miss Youngblood, returned for Miss Smith, but she had disappeared and the body did not rise to the surface again until it was recovered this morning.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Miss Smith was a brunette, but when the body was found, her hair had turned white.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The body was taken to the J.A. Moore undertaking parlors here and later was taken to Sunny Hill Cemetery, near Sandersville in Washington County, where the funeral service took place this afternoon.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Oconee River where the nurses and William Layfield went walking Friday evening is normally shallow, but there had been a sudden rise, due to rains up stream, and they got into water over their heads. &amp;nbsp;Neither of the nurses could swim.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Miss Smith was from Bartow, Ga. &amp;nbsp;Her father can here at once as soon as news of the drowning reached him and he kept a constant vigil along the river, with scores of other persons, during Friday night, Saturday, and Saturday night.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;GIRL DROWNS: FRIEND SAVED BY SMALL BOY&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Miss Eunice Smith, Nurse at State Sanitarium, Lost in Oconee&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;HER BODY NOT YET FOUND&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;William Layfield, 14, Proves Himself a Hero During Emergency&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga. &amp;nbsp;Aug 14. &amp;nbsp;A 14-year-old boy late yesterday saved the life of Miss Mary Youndblood, 18, a nurse at the Georgia State Sanitarium, when the treacherous waters of the Oconee River below Fort Wilkinson closed over her head. &amp;nbsp;But he was unable to save Miss Eunice Smith, 18, of Bartow, Ga., whose body was sucked under by the current and has not yet been found by searching parties.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Misses Youngblood and Smith were wading in the middle of the river, which previously had been shallow, but which recent rains upstream had treacherously swollen. &amp;nbsp;Suddenly both girls went under. &amp;nbsp;William Layfiled, 14, was with them, but wading near the shore. &amp;nbsp;He hastened to the rescue, and pulled Miss Youngblood safely to shore. &amp;nbsp;Then he returned to save Miss Smith, but it was too late. &amp;nbsp;Her body had disappeared for the last time.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Parties of searchers have been dragging the river all last night and throughout today, but without success. &amp;nbsp;The search is continuing tonight.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The condition of the Oconee was not anticipated by the girls, as they had visited the stream frequently of recent days, and found no deep water. &amp;nbsp;Parents living in that section have been taking their children there to wade. &amp;nbsp;A near freshet, however, was precipitated by the upstream rains, and the water at the point now is about six feet deep.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Miss Smith&apos;s father, who lives at Bartow, Ga., hurried here when he was advised of her death. &amp;nbsp;He is assisting in the search for her body.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Miss Youngblood did not suffer seriously from her experiences.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Gerald Smith, 6, Ran in Front of Automobile&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gerald Smith, six-year-old son of Mr. And Mrs. Kendrick Smith, of Bath, was crushed to death about 5:00 o&apos;clock Tuesday afternoon when he was struck by an automobile driven by Mrs. Dan Miller of Leesville, S.C. According to Sheriff Price Fallaw.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The accident happened on the highway in front of a tourist camp between Bath and Langley. &amp;nbsp;The child was playing with other children and ran out on the highway in front of the approaching car, the sheriff said.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mrs. Miller was returning to her home in Leesville at the time of the accident. &amp;nbsp;The sheriff said he did not learn the identity of her woman companion.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Coroner Tom Tarver investigated the accident along with Deputy Sheriff C.L. Hartley and County Patrolman C.M. Courtney. &amp;nbsp;He said a coroner&apos;s inquest will be held at a date to be selected later.&lt;/div&gt;

        <Transcription>&lt;div&gt;Death of Doctor Zerbe&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The announcement of the death of Dr. Jonathan Zerbe, of Shaefferstown, which took place last night at 10:16 o&apos;clock p.m., yesterday, will be received throughout the county with more than ordinary degree of sorrow. &amp;nbsp;Dr. Zerbe has been ailing for some time past from cancer of the stomach, which fatal malady ended his career among men. &amp;nbsp;He was known as among the most prominent men in our county, and possessed the confidence of the people as few men do.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Born in Berks county in 1812, he grew up a devotee to the science of medicine which study he prosecuted with great success, graduating in the year 1837. &amp;nbsp;On finishing his medical studies he located himself in Shaefferstown, where he practiced his profession ever since -- a period of about 40 years. &amp;nbsp;In 1861 he was an independent candidate for the State Senate, running against Amos R. Boughter, Esq. &amp;nbsp;At a later period he was elected by the people of Lebanon county to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and the year following he declined a second election. &amp;nbsp;Last fall his name was before the Republican County Convention for nomination again for the legislature, and came within one of receiving the nomination.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;His influence as a citizen and politicians was not to be despised, being felt in every section of the country. &amp;nbsp;His funeral will take place in Shaefferstown on Sunday morning next.&lt;/div&gt;</Transcription>
