\chapter{Introduction}

The newspaper articles, obituaries, death notices, and marriage notices contained in this volume have been essential in bringing together the family's genealogy.  They have been an invaluable source of accurate family information which is otherwise difficult to obtain.  On more than one occasion, information in an obituary helped to correct errors in many historical references which relied on gravestone and memories.

The articles in this volume written after 1922 may still covered by the copyright of the publishing newspaper.  The transcripts were obtained and copied as a fair use of the articles for research purposes.  Each article is accompanied by a citation.  No permission has been obtained to copy or distribute any article in this volume.
