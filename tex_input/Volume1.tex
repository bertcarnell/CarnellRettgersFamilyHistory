\chapter{Preface}

I started the journey to document our family history in 2014 after both my grandfathers had passed away, Curtis T Carnell (1922-1991) and Robert E Rettgers (1923-2014).  They were both part of the Greatest Generation, both volunteered before Pearl Harbor, and both served their country to the utmost of their ability in the Pacific.  Neither one talked much about their military service.  Grandpa Curtis said that the Japanese were coming, but never got to him.  Grandpa Bob talked about the interesting mechanical and electronic aspects of destroyer gunnery, some about ship board life, and about one kamikaze attack on his ship.  Neither one talked about the terrible aspects of war that they experienced.  I will always regret not having asked more questions and not having said thank-you for what they did.  I only hope that I am honoring them with this effort.  I never would have expected to find the incredible people in my family.  Immigrants, pioneers, farmers, and heroes fill these pages.  

I have been helped along the way by many of family members.  My mother and father have been a tremendous help in collecting the family's knowledge, visiting relatives, and documenting graves from Georgia to Pennsylvania.  I also made use of other's work in the beginning of the project.  My Aunt, Sharon Rettgers Idema, had done quite a bit of research at the Family History Center on the Rettgers / Fett family and graciously provided it all.  Cousin, Shirley Quackebush Frye (1950-2002) had done extensive research on the Smith / Josey branch all before the internet made this much easier.  Finally, Janice McMillan has been my window into learning about the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution and about how to be a careful amateur genealogist.

If you come across any errors or omissions in these pages, please contact me.  I will ask that you provide references or documents if possible.  As you can see from the extensive footnotes in these pages, I make every effort to include original sources when possible.
