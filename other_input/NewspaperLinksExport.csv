  A Glen Rose man was killed Monday night after his motorcycle struck a car on State Highway 144 South.
  Gregory Charles Cornell, 40, a laid-off engineer from Comanche Peak nuclear plant, died of head injuries, said highway patrol trooper Dub Gillum.   
  Gillum gave an account of the 7:45 p.m. accident that occurred near Flip Stop convenience store.
  Cornell was southbound on State Highway 144 South on a 1984 Harley-Davidson motorcycle.  James Roger Shackleford, 39, a Granbury auto mechanic, was southbound ahead of Cornell in a 1969 Ford LTD.  Shackleford slowed down to turn into a private drive.  As Shackleford started to turn, Cornell attempted to pass his vehicle in the northbound lane.  Cornell's motorcycle then struck Shackleford's car in the rear.  Cornell was thrown from the motorcycle and died when his head struck the pavement.  Shackleford's car went off the road after impact and struck a fence. 
  Cornell was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, but it didn’t save his life, said Gillum.  The helmet, which Gillum described as a bowl-style helmet, was not Department of Transportation (DOT) approved.
  A sample of Cornell's blood was taken to determine if alcohol was a factor in the accident, Gillum stated.
  No citations were filed, Gillum reported, adding the investigation is continuing.
  Cornell's body was transferred to Georgia yesterday for burial, Gillum said, adding he is survived by a wife, a 4-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter.",TRUE

FLOYD W. FETT
 
Floyd W. Fett, 65, veteran advertising man, former publisher and a past potentate of Rajah Temple, died from a hear attack at 4:15 p.m. yesterday at his home, 924 Madison Ave.
 
He had been under the care of a physician since suffering a heart attack about one year ago, but recently was in apparently good health and on Friday performed his usual duties as a display advertising salesman for the Reading Eagle-Times.  He spent yesterday at home.
 
Early in the afternoon he complained of severe heart pains and went to bed.  Members of the family summoned his physician, but he was dead when the doctor arrived.

Mrs. Hannah Fry, who will celebrate her 91st Birthday to-morrow -- the Mother of 9 children -- Sheared Sheep and Spun Wool in Her Younger Days
  Birdsboro:  In these days of hurry and scurry, disregard for the rules of hygiene and other regulations that conduces to longevity, one scarcely hears of the survival of a resident beyond the three score and ten limit.  Should there perchance be one who reached the age of ""four score years,"" such person is regarded as one specially favored by Providence, and the dwellers in the neighborhood flock to see him or her and listen to the recital of long ago happening and endeavoring to learn the secret of their drawn out lease of life.
  Birdsboro feels proud of the distinction of having a dweller in its midst who has withstood the tempestuous sea for the unusual period of more than 90 years.  This person is Mrs. Hannah Fry, who on Monday next, Sept. 23, will celebrate the 91st anniversary of her birth.  The history of this old lady is a very interesting one and her memory reaches back to the war of 1812.
  Mrs. Fry was born September 23, 1804, in Robeson, about 1 1/2 miles from the Plow church.  Her father was Jacob Seibert, a thrifty farmer, who prided himself upon the constant find condition of his land and his successful raising of stock.  Her mother's name was Catharine, and she was the daughter of Jasper Wolf, who also was a farmer living near Beckersville.  When a girl, Mrs. Fry attended the Plow school, a short distance from her father's house; but the frequent necessity of her remaining at home to assist her mother in the housework, dairy, etc., deprived her of the means of acquiring much if an education, and her knowledge of books is very limited.  She feels the loss of advantages in this direction exceedingly, as she could employ her time in reading, were she better skilled in the art.
  She was married to Peter Fry, of Robeson, who was then a school teacher and afterwards worked at the stone-mason trade.  He died 22 years ago and Mrs. Fry no makes her home with Mrs. Charles Painter, her granddaughter, on Mill st., this borough.  After the death of her husband, she states, that many of her friends advised her to marry a second time, but she disdained their counsel, thinking that she had had trouble enough in one experience.  She kindly cautioned your representative against taking a matrimonial step and assured him that she make a point of similarly discouraging all her young friends.
  Mrs. Fry had 3 brothers, John, Jacob, and Abram, all of whom are now dead after reaching ages varying from 60 to 70 years.  Her sisters, of whom she had 3, were Kate, who was first married to Isaac Glass and after this death to Isaac Witman; Betsy, married to Geo. Blankenbiller, and Mary, who was never married.  All these are now dead, the last named having passed to her rest last August, aged 80 years.
  Mrs. Fry has in her possession a certificate that is written in German and decorated with many colored drawings as a border, and is filled out as follows:
  ""Mrs. Hannah Fry, daughter of Jacob Seibert and his wife Catharine (Wolf), was born in Robeson township, Berks county, September 23, 1804, a three o'clock in the morning.  Baptized in infancy in the Plow church by Rev. John Plott.  The sponsors were Casper Wolf and wife, Catharine.""
  The writing is in a very good hand, and distinct, while the certificate, with the exception of a few breaks where the folds are, is in a very good state of preservation.
  The old lady was a regular attendant upon the services at the Plow church for many years, but did not become a member of any congregation until she came to reside in Birdsboro.  She then decided to identify herself with St. Mark's Lutheran church here, and was confirmed by the pastor, Rev. Z. H. Gable, on Saturday afternoon, April 29, 1983, and has since been a consistent communicant and attended service whenever able to do so.  Many are the interesting reminisc",TRUE

TRAGIC END OF A READING AVIATOR
 
Herbert Hartenstein, of this city, a quartermaster in the naval air service of the United States government, met death in a most tragic manner on Monday, when the seaplane in which he, with others, was making a practice flight over the bay at Chatham, Mass., enveloped in a tailspin and fell.  Hartenstein and Lieut. Charles L Ostridge of Watertown, Mass., were drowned, while a third member of the crew.  Everett P. Welsh, was rescued by another seaplane.
  This information was received by his wife, Mrs. Laura Hartenstein, 1017 Oley street, by telegraph.  The message follows:  ""Chatham, Mass., May 19.  While making a practice flight over the bay here at 11 a.m. Monday, a naval seaplane in which Quartermaster Herbert Hartenstein was an occupant enveloped into a tailspin and fell, causing the death of Quartermaster Hartenstein.""
  Another telegram followed, which informed the widow that members of the coast guard made unsuccessful efforts to resuscitate the Reading man, who was the first recovered.  The body of Lieut. Ostridge, of Watertown, Mass., who was drowned in the same accident, is still lost at sea.
Sorrow Follows Happiness
  The telegram informing Mrs. Hartenstein of the death of her husband arrived at their modest little home shortly after the wife had finished reading a letter of happiness received from her husband.  Hartenstein, in the letter, stated that he expected his discharge from the air service early in July and that he was going to return to Reading.  The wife is heartbroken and said:  ""I gave all I had.""  As her three-year-old son clung to her apron the stricken wife, wrought up over the news, explained through sobs how her husband met his death.
  On Dec. 31, 1917, Hartenstein enlisted in the Naval Reserve Corpse at Philadelphia.  After receiving his preliminary training at a station there, he was transferred to Pensacola, Fla., where he remained until February, 1918.  In the early part of March, he was assigned to a naval air service unit and embarked for France.  He saw active service in foreign waters and was later attached to a patrol crew which moved between Brest and Bordeaux.
Following the signing of the armistice he, with his unit, left France for the States, arriving here Nov. 24, 1918.  He spent Thanksgiving Day visiting his wife and little son in Reading.  Upon his return to duty, he was reassigned to a patrol crew along Pelham Bay, N.Y.  In March he was removed to Chatham, Mass., where he was stationed for patrol duty.
  The visit to his relatives in this city on Thanksgiving Day was a surprise.  None had heard of his safe arrival from overseas and when he entered his home on Oley street, his wife and parents were for a time speechless.
  Blue Star Changed to Gold.
  Upon the front door at the Oley street home, hangs a good size silk service flag bearing one blue star in the field of white.  ""That star will be replace by a gold one, "" she said, ""and will hang on that door form some time to come.  He never cared for the display, but it was the only way in which we could demonstrate our admiration for his bravery and patriotism.""
Quartermaster Hartenstein was 24 years old.  He was the son of Mrs. Thomas F. Torpey (nee Miller) and the late Jacob Hartenstein.  He was born at St. Peter's, Chester county.  His father died when he was very young.  Hartenstein received his education at Girard College, Philadelphia, and came to Reading at the age of 16 years.  He was a plumber and Steam fitter in the employ of I.D. Mohn & Co., while in this city.

  Mechanicsburg, Pa., Sept. 10 -- William A Heckard, of Harrisburg today watched helplessly as a tractor-trailer plunged into the automobile wreckage where his way lay pinned.  State Police said Mrs. Nellie Heckard, 44, probably died instantly.
  Heckard told police he may have fallen asleep early today while he and his wife were driving to a son's home in nearby Dillsburg, Pa.
  Police said Heckard's car left Route 15 four miles south of Dillsburg, climbed a bank and then turned over on its side in the middle of the highway.

  William A. Heckard, 36, of Mt. Holly Springs, was held guilty of ""some negligence"" in the death of his wife who, a coroner's jury decided was killed when the Heckard car overturned and not when a truck crashed into the wreckage a short time later.
  The jury exonerated the truck driver, Charles E. Lau, 27, of Palmyra, of all blame in the woman's death.
  The accident occurred September 10 in the Williams Grove road near Rose Garden.  Dr. Edward A Haegele, Cumberland county coroner, directed in the inquest.  He said Heckard's car containing his 44-year-old wife, Mrs. Nellie Heckard, turned over.  Mrs. Heckard was pinned in the wreckage.  While Heckard and a passing truck driver were trying to extricate her, another truck, driven by Lau, crashed into the wrecked car.  Mrs. Heckard was dead when a physician arrived.",TRUE

  One person was killed and two escaped injury at 4 o'clock Friday morning when an overturned automobile was struck and completely demolished by a tractor-trailer on the Gettysburg-Harrisburg Pike about four miles south of Dillsburg.
  Killed instantly was Mrs. Nellie Heckard, 44, of Harrisburg, who died from a broken neck, fractured skull, crushed chest, broken right arm and two broken legs.
 
Drivers Unhurt
 
  Escaping serious injury were Mrs. Heckard's husband, William A., 36, operator of the automobile, and Charles Lau, 27 of Palmyra, driver of the tractor trailer.
  Coroner E.A. Huegele, who conducted an investigation along with State Police, reported that Heckard's car, which was traveling south, swerved to right, went over an embankment, and swerved back into the middle of the highway where it came to a stop upside down.  Heckard, who was dazed when the car rolled over, was attempting to extricate his wife, when the huge tractor-trailer came over the brow of the hill.  Lau told State Police he was unable to stop before striking the Heckard automobile.  Mrs. Heckard's body was carried 200 feet in the demolished automobile.  Coroner Huegele said.  The Heckards were en route to Dillsburg R.D. 1 to visit Mrs. Heckard's son, Curtis T. Cornell.
 
Auto Demolished
 
  The tractor-trailer was owned by Ernest R. Nelson, of Palmyra.  There was little damage to the truck buy Coroner Huegele reported the entire front of the automobile was sheared off by the impact.
  The Mechanicsburg ambulance took Heckard to the Seidle Memorial Hospital in Mechanicsburg, where he was treated for minor lacerations.  Lau escaped without a scratch.  Heckard was unable to give a reason for his car going out of control and leaving the highway.
  Pending an inquest at a later date, both Heckard and Lau were released in $1,000 bond for their appearances.",TRUE

Closes Long Career
 
Love of Work is Blamed for His Last Illness
 
  Unfailing devotion to duty and stubborn refusal to heed ailments of advancing years led to the death of Postmaster Walter A. Ringler, his widow said today.
  The 71-year-old former assemblyman, county commissioner and city assessor, who would have rounded out 15 years as head of the Reading Post Office on June 28 succumbed in St. Joseph's Hospital at 9:45 o'clock last night.  He would have been 72 on March 7.  Funeral arrangements had not been completed this morning.
  Although death was attributed directly to a brain injury caused either by a paralytic stroke or a fall against a radiator at his home, 47 South Eight St., Ringler suffered from exhaustion and heart trouble, Mrs. Ringler disclosed.
  The postmaster caught a cold attending the funeral of County Commissioner John G. Keller, Ringer's personal friend and Democratic colleague of many years, who died 21 days ago.  Mrs. Ringler said that her husband refused to call a doctor until the cold developed into a touch of pneumonia and his temperature was 104 degrees.
  It was while recuperating that he suffered the fall, but he was not taken to the hospital until about a week later.  He was semi-conscious after his admittance to the hospital last Monday.  He failed to rally to treatment after numerous tests and X-rays.
  Mrs. Ringler said that working was her husband's pleasure and for this reason he rarely took a vacation.  She said he preferred to stay in harness despite his advancing years.
 
Leave Days Accumulated
 
  His refusal to take a vacation from his post office duties piled up for him a total of approximately 183 days owed him by the department.  This was reduced to about 80 at the time of his death because his superiors in Washington ordered him take off one or two days a week during the last year or so.
  Ringler always said he would take a long vacation when he retired.
  The 19-story court house, the county tuberculosis hospital and prison in Bern Township and the Buttonwood Street Bridge today stand as monuments to Ringler's career.
  It was during the 12 years that he was chairman of the county board of commissioners that these projects were constructed.  He directed the inauguration and supervision of a county program of public improvements the like of which never before and probably never again will be accomplished in a similar period of time.
  It was also under Ringler's chairmanship that the county launched a road-building program that gave Berks its first hard-surfaced rural highways.  Millions of dollars were expended for these various improvements and new buildings.
 
Had Simple Life
 
  Although he ran the post office with the efficiency of a big business executive, his private life was simple.  Virtually his only pastime, except for an occasional motion picture, was a late afternoon pinochle game with a few cronies at the Americus Club.  Otherwise he enjoyed quiet evenings at home with his wife, the former Mary S. Hartenstine.  They had no children.
  During his postmastership, postal receipts here increased from $660,000 to more than $1,500,000 annually.
  While in office Ringler won the esteem of his employees when his name was placed on the honor roll of the National Federation of Post Office Clerks.  This honor is accorded to post office officials who ignore politics and personal favoritism and adhere rigidly to seniority rules in making appointment.  Ringler's name was placed on the honor roll upon nomination of the Reading members of the federation.
  Although running the post office was his immediate concern, Ringler enjoyed talking of the days when he was a county commissioner and directed many fights to give Berks County modern institutions and services.  He prided himself that he accomplished all these things as a self-made and self-educated man without much formal schooling.
  He was born on a farm in Exeter Township on March 7,",TRUE

Miss Eunice Smith, Nurse at State Sanitarium, Lost in Oconee
 
HER BODY NOT YET FOUND
 
William Layfield, 14, Proves Himself a Hero During Emergency
 
MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga.  Aug 14.  A 14-year-old boy late yesterday saved the life of Miss Mary Youndblood, 18, a nurse at the Georgia State Sanitarium, when the treacherous waters of the Oconee River below Fort Wilkinson closed over her head.  But he was unable to save Miss Eunice Smith, 18, of Bartow, Ga., whose body was sucked under by the current and has not yet been found by searching parties.
  Misses Youngblood and Smith were wading in the middle of the river, which previously had been shallow, but which recent rains upstream had treacherously swollen.  Suddenly both girls went under.  William Layfiled, 14, was with them, but wading near the shore.  He hastened to the rescue, and pulled Miss Youngblood safely to shore.  Then he returned to save Miss Smith, but it was too late.  Her body had disappeared for the last time.
  Parties of searchers have been dragging the river all last night and throughout today, but without success.  The search is continuing tonight.
  The condition of the Oconee was not anticipated by the girls, as they had visited the stream frequently of recent days, and found no deep water.  Parents living in that section have been taking their children there to wade.  A near freshet, however, was precipitated by the upstream rains, and the water at the point now is about six feet deep.
  Miss Smith's father, who lives at Bartow, Ga., hurried here when he was advised of her death.  He is assisting in the search for her body.
  Miss Youngblood did not suffer seriously from her experiences.",TRUE

  MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga., Aug 15 - (AP) - Arthur Layfield today dived into the Oconee river near here and brought up the body of his fiancee, Miss Eunice Smith, graduate nurse at the Georgia State Sanitarium, who drowned yesterday when she waded in the stream beyond her depth.  Layfield was a member of a searching party seeking the young woman's body.  She was found half a mile from the point where she was last seen in the river.
  Layfield is a brother of William Layfield, 14, who rescued Miss Mary Youngblood, another nurse of the State Sanitarium, who was wading in the stream with Miss Smith Friday evening, when both sand from sight.
  The younger Layfield, after rescuing Miss Youngblood, returned for Miss Smith, but she had disappeared and the body did not rise to the surface again until it was recovered this morning.

   The body was taken to the J.A. Moore undertaking parlors here and later was taken to Sunny Hill Cemetery, near Sandersville in Washington County, where the funeral service took place this afternoon.
  The Oconee River where the nurses and William Layfield went walking Friday evening is normally shallow, but there had been a sudden rise, due to rains up stream, and they got into water over their heads.  Neither of the nurses could swim.

  The announcement of the death of Dr. Jonathan Zerbe, of Shaefferstown, which took place last night at 10:16 o'clock p.m., yesterday, will be received throughout the county with more than ordinary degree of sorrow.  Dr. Zerbe has been ailing for some time past from cancer of the stomach, which fatal malady ended his career among men.  He was known as among the most prominent men in our county, and possessed the confidence of the people as few men do.
  Born in Berks county in 1812, he grew up a devotee to the science of medicine which study he prosecuted with great success, graduating in the year 1837.  On finishing his medical studies he located himself in Shaefferstown, where he practiced his profession ever since -- a period of about 40 years.  In 1861 he was an independent candidate for the State Senate, running against Amos R. Boughter, Esq.  At a later period he was elected by the people of Lebanon county to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and the year following he declined a second election.  Last fall his name was before the Republican County Convention for nomination again for the legislature, and came within one of receiving the nomination.
  His influence as a citizen and politicians was not to be despised, being felt in every section of the country.  His funeral will take place in Shaefferstown on Sunday morning next.",TRUE
